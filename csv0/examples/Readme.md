##### rw
This is the complete implementation of both the read side and the write side

##### read1
This is a version that reads one file

##### read2
This is a version that reads a set of files in a particular directory,
and just prints out the vectors in real time

##### read3
This returns the actual vector of HashMaps which will then get sent
into the write_processor
